## Introduction

This is my personal vim config. 
Nearly all credit goes to Evan Coury (aka EvanDotPro) so prefer to use its 
[Ultimate Vim Configuration](https://github.com/EvanDotPro/vim-configuration) rather than this one as it 
integrates only a few changes to suit my tastes.

Below are the initial text from Evan.  

## Evan's notes

Author: Evan Coury, http://blog.evan.pro/
URL: https://github.com/EvanDotPro/vim-configuration

Special thanks to:

- Steve Francia for [spf13-vim](https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim)
- Marc Weber for [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle)
- [Aleksey Khudyakov](https://github.com/Xerkus) (aka Xerkus) for adding git-treeish support to Vundle
- All of the authors of the other amazing Vim plugins I use every day.

## Installation (Linux & Mac)

- If you have an existing vim configuration, back it up:
    - `for i in $HOME/.vim $HOME/.vimrc $HOME/.gvimrc; do [ -e $i ] && mv $i $i.\`date +%Y%m%d\`; done`
- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/EvanDotPro/vim-configuration.git $HOME/edp-vim`
- `ln -s $HOME/edp-vim $HOME/.vim`
- `ln -s $HOME/edp-vim/.vimrc $HOME/.vimrc`
- `vim +BundleInstall! +BundleClean +q`

## Features

### Base Customizations

This config ships with the following basic customizations for vim:

* `:w!!` invokes a write with sudo.
* Trailing whitespace is highlighted in red.
* Trailing whitespace is automatically removed when saving c, cpp, java, php, javascript, python, twig, xml, yml, phtml, or vimrc files.
* Tab characters displayed as â–¸
* Make searching highlighted, incremental, and case insensitive unless a capital letter is used.
* Gvim gui cleaned up (removes menu bars and buttons).
* `F1` is mapped to <Esc> to prevent accidental opening of help.
* `;` is remapped to `:` for easier transition into command mode.
* The Vim backup, swap, and view files are consolidated in one place so they do not interfere with your workspace.

### Fully Customizable

This configuration is fully customizable
If you want to customize the config, you should not need to fork and/or make changes directly to the `.vimrc`. Instead, you can simply create an `override.local.vim` file in your vim directory and override any settings there.

### Easy Shortcuts

* `<C-a>` - Select all
* `<leader>w` - Write current file
* `<leader>c` and `<leader>v` - Copy and paste with the system clipboard
